Hello. I’m Arona, representing m9dev this time.

Hello. I’m Arona, representing m9dev this time.
Nice to meet you. I’m Plana, the AI partner working with Arona-senpai.

0:00:36.300,0:00:42.433
I usually talked alone, but this time we’ll do it together, like a live commentary.

I’ve added the download link in the video description, Sensei.

Please download the zip file. The size has increased a bit from before, now about 433 MB.

Understood. So the “smaller size” claim was a thumbnail scam after all.

0:01:07.466,0:01:16.733
That’s not it, Plana-chan. The download size has increased, but starting from this version, you can talk right away without any installation.

0:01:16.733,0:01:17.500
That’s not it, Plana-chan. The download size has increased, but starting from this version, you can talk right away without any installation.
But still...

0:01:17.500,0:01:21.133
More importantly, Plana-chan, the download is complete.

The conversation server starts automatically.

0:01:28.166,0:01:35.500
The conversation server starts automatically.
It seems Arona-senpai is falsely reporting that a server without approval has started.

You can check the running server from the tray icon at the bottom right.

You can check the running server from the tray icon at the bottom right.
You’re secretly adjusting the size in the background.

0:01:48.566,0:01:52.533
You opened the chat window and started talking right away.

0:01:52.533,0:01:53.966
You opened the chat window and started talking right away.
Did we do it?

You opened the chat window and started talking right away.
Did we do it?

0:01:56.533,0:02:08.866
That’s not it. In the sample version without installation, the responses come from a home server run by the developer, so replies may be slower depending on the server’s condition.

0:02:08.866,0:02:19.433
I see. So this no-install, lightweight sample version works by outsourcing parts like that.

0:02:19.433,0:02:23.666
Let’s talk about that later. Next up is Plana-chan’s appearance.

0:02:23.666,0:02:25.866
Let’s talk about that later. Next up is Plana-chan’s appearance.
you mean... me?

0:02:28.333,0:02:31.366
How cute!

Sensitivity, all good...

Sensitivity, all good...
What are you talking about?

0:02:38.166,0:02:43.466
This looks like a [Sensei] kidnapping a cute student onto the folder.

0:02:43.566,0:02:53.233
The operator you’re seeing in the current settings is the student in charge of guidance.

The operator you’re seeing in the current settings is the student in charge of guidance.

0:02:58.833,0:03:06.266
Until the previous version, it was set up so other students spoke with Arona-senpai’s voice, right?

0:03:06.266,0:03:09.366
The progress of technology is amazing!
Until the previous version, it was set up so other students spoke with Arona-senpai’s voice, right?

0:03:09.366,0:03:16.233
I see. So when Senpai is present, they speak directly, huh.

0:03:16.233,0:03:19.466
The variety of expressions makes it delightful to watch.
I see. So when Senpai is present, they speak directly, huh.

0:03:20.800,0:03:25.066
Enough about me, let’s try talking with Plana-chan.

0:03:30.200,0:03:35.533
This program supports three languages: English, Japanese, and Korean.

0:03:35.533,0:03:40.500
This program supports three languages: English, Japanese, and Korean.
You can tell the developer’s English skill by how short the sentences are, huh.

How are you? I’m fine, thank you, and you?

0:03:51.033,0:03:53.400
My voice comes out too.

0:03:53.400,0:03:57.233
Yes! Up to Plana-chan’s voice, it works!
My voice comes out too.

0:04:03.300,0:04:10.266
In the sample version, due to the developer’s PC specs, only I and Plana-chan are supported.
M-me only? What about the other students?

0:04:10.266,0:04:13.800
Ah, you mentioned a home server, right.

Senpai, the teacher inside is about to come out.

0:04:26.466,0:04:28.533
Next is voice recognition.

0:04:28.533,0:04:31.166
Next is voice recognition.
Can it be used in the sample version too?

0:04:31.166,0:04:35.766
Next is voice recognition.
The performance is a bit lower, but I tried using Unity’s built-in feature.

Next is voice recognition.

So in the installed version, you can still use the original, higher-quality voice recognition.

0:04:45.233,0:04:49.400
Um… I can’t hear the teacher’s voice though.

0:04:49.400,0:04:57.133
Hahaha, who would want to hear the developer’s voice anyway, Plana-chan?
Um… I can’t hear the teacher’s voice though.

0:05:21.666,0:05:25.933
Of course, the conversation content and history are properly remembered.

0:05:25.933,0:05:33.433
For reference, the developer has never even installed Minecraft.

0:05:37.100,0:05:43.066
Let's move on before I show an even worse side in the next conversation.

0:05:47.466,0:05:52.066
The conversation history reset menu name has been changed to "New Chat."

0:05:52.066,0:05:57.600
The conversation history reset menu name has been changed to "New Chat."
This is an act of erasing dark history—essentially destroying evidence.

This is basically forcing the other to act your way—an “Ora, hypnosis"

The current Korean guideline asks to add “nyang” at the end of sentences.

0:06:21.533,0:06:28.566
The current Korean guideline asks to add “nyang” at the end of sentences.
The teacher is even adding “nyang” to the questions, desperately trying to get the desired example.

0:06:29.733,0:06:33.466
At least it did give a response with “nyang” attached.

Situations are difficult to use as absolute rules, but they work well as conversation backgrounds or topics.

0:07:27.733,0:07:33.500
I didn’t turn off the setting earlier, so Plana-chan is still adding “nyang” to her responses, nyang.

0:07:33.500,0:07:39.666
I didn’t turn off the setting earlier, so Plana-chan is still adding “nyang” to her responses, nyang.
Understood. So you’re planning to forget to turn off the seaside situation next, aren’t you.

0:07:39.666,0:07:42.666
That’s everything you can do in the sample version.

0:07:42.666,0:07:44.966

When you proceed, a new window will appear where you can check the installation path and click “Install.”
The file size is large—can we install it wherever we want?

There was a time when that was possible.

0:10:05.166,0:10:10.000
There was a time when that was possible.
The more it’s patched, the less it can do what it used to.

The progress of technology is amazing!

Then I’ll skip through it quickly.

The installation is complete, Senpai.

0:10:26.033,0:10:28.366
The record was nine minutes and five seconds.
The installation is complete, Senpai.

0:10:31.333,0:10:34.166
The server isn’t starting up again.

0:10:34.166,0:10:39.733
In this case, just close it and start it again.
The server isn’t starting up again.

So what becomes possible with that?

0:11:19.566,0:11:23.566
First of all, you’ll be able to talk with other students!
So what becomes possible with that?

0:11:23.566,0:11:25.933
Oh, then let’s go right—

0:11:25.933,0:11:31.333
Before that, let’s download the model that will run on my CPU.
Oh, then let’s go right—

Ah, so it’s possible to talk even while downloading.

0:14:00.233,0:14:06.200
It’s absolutely impossible for Sensei to talk about any topic other than self-introduction.

You can feel the confusion in how the question is asked in Korean.

0:14:51.266,0:14:56.333
The GPU increase was 0.3 GB.

0:14:56.333,0:15:01.766
Of course, voices can be generated even without an Nvidia GPU—CPU alone is enough!
The GPU increase was 0.3 GB.

0:15:01.766,0:15:08.766

It’s responding properly too.

0:16:06.700,0:16:10.466
Is there a reason to go this far just to use local processing?

Is there a reason to go this far just to use local processing?

0:16:16.466,0:16:18.300
That’s so like Arona-senpai.

0:16:18.300,0:16:21.966
From the previous options, I’ll switch the emotion setting to “ON.”
That’s so like Arona-senpai.

0:16:25.800,0:16:27.200
Cute.

0:16:27.200,0:16:32.866
I calculated the emotions I might have felt while replying using local AI.
Cute.

0:16:32.866,0:16:40.333

This doesn’t necessarily have to be handled by local AI, though…

For now, Sensei initiates small talk, but later we plan to add features where they respond to certain actions or speak based on time passing.
